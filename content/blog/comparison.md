## following the prestigious path

When I look back at high school, I see a version of myself that was always looking around, constantly measuring against the people beside me. I did not really know what I wanted, so I gravitated toward paths that seemed prestigious, like STEM classes, coding programs, and math competitions. I did these things not because they excited me, but because I thought they would make me look competent and ambitious. I wanted to appear capable, like I had everything figured out, even when I did not.

I remember grade seven coding classes clearly. I would sit at the computer, staring at the blank screen, unsure what to type. Other students seemed to understand the concepts effortlessly while I felt slow and frustrated. I would leave the class feeling defeated, thinking maybe I just was not cut out for this. Years later, when I returned to programming on my own terms, I discovered a genuine love for it. That small realization hit me hard. I had spent so much energy chasing approval rather than curiosity and it showed me how quietly destructive comparison could be.

Even outside coding, I followed similar patterns. I joined math competitions and science programs, not because I was passionate, but because I assumed they would make me look good. At the time, I convinced myself that this was ambition, but in reality, it was fear. Fear of being ordinary, fear of being left behind, fear of being seen as less than.

## the self-destructive cycle

High school quickly became a loop of self-comparison. I would see classmates' awards, summer programs, and volunteer experiences and instantly feel that I was falling behind. I set increasingly ambitious goals, believing that ambition alone would prove my worth. Yet I rarely paused to recognize what I had already achieved. Every milestone felt fleeting, always overshadowed by the next one I had not yet reached.

One moment stands out vividly. I had been nominated for a prestigious scholarship at my school, an honor that recognized academic achievement and leadership. There were so many talented students in my year and part of me felt I did not deserve it. Even after being nominated, I could not shake the feeling that someone else would have been a better choice. Instead of celebrating, I felt anxious and unworthy. I replayed every small mistake I had made over the years and convinced myself that this recognition was a fluke. It was a strange combination of pride and discomfort and a clear reminder of how deeply comparison had taken root in my mindset.

I also remember one calculus test. My grade was lower than I expected. It was not a failing mark, but I replayed every mistake in my head for hours. I convinced myself I would never get into my dream program. I began avoiding expectations as a way to protect myself from disappointment. In reality, I was shutting myself off from pride and satisfaction. When I eventually received my acceptance letter, it should have been the happiest moment of my life. Instead, it felt muted because I had trained my mind to filter all success through comparison.

## external pressures

University intensified these pressures. At the University of Waterloo, I was surrounded by brilliant and driven peers. Some had co-ops in California, others were conducting research, and some were founding startups before turning twenty. It seemed like everyone had a plan while I was scrambling to keep up.

I spent late nights scrolling through LinkedIn, comparing resumes and achievements, asking myself if mine were impressive enough. Sometimes I pursued opportunities for the reputation rather than personal or professional growth. Even when I accomplished something meaningful, I struggled to feel proud because my mind was already shifting to the next goal.

I remember one evening sitting on the floor of my dorm, laptop on my knees, endlessly checking emails for co-op postings. I felt drained, anxious, and inadequate even though I had worked hard and earned every opportunity I had. It was then that I began to realize how much pressure I had internalized and how little of it actually reflected what I truly valued.

## psychological insight

Eventually, I learned there was a name for what I had been experiencing. It is called upward social comparison. Psychologically, it is natural to measure yourself against those who seem more successful. It can motivate, but when self-worth depends on it, it becomes exhausting and destructive.

For me, this habit caused anxiety, self-doubt, and a distorted sense of achievement. I realized that I had spent so much time comparing myself to others that I lost sight of my own growth and accomplishments.

The turning point came when I started asking myself difficult questions. Am I pursuing this because I want to or because I feel I should? Which accomplishments truly matter to me independent of what anyone else thinks? Slowly, I began to understand that comparison can inspire growth, but it should never define your worth. Fulfillment comes from self-awareness, reflection, and noticing progress on your own terms.

## a work in progress

The most important lesson I have learned is that comparison will always exist, but it does not have to control me. Ambition is important, but reflection is equally important. Growth is valuable, but recognizing your own accomplishments is just as critical. My worth is not tied to someone else's co-op, resume, or internship. It is rooted in my own skills, experiences, and values.

I am still learning this. I still feel that familiar pang of doubt when scrolling through LinkedIn. I still wonder if I am doing enough. But I have started pausing, reflecting, and appreciating the progress I have made. I celebrate small wins, like finishing a project I care about, learning a new skill, or simply taking time to slow down.

Growth is not a race. It is a journey, and it is okay for it to take time. I am learning that my path does not have to look like anyone else's. I am learning to measure success not by comparison, but by my own growth, my own values, and my own joy.
