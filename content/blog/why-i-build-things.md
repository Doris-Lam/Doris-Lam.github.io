## following the prestigious path

For most of my life, I compared myself to everyone around me. In high school, I did not really know what I wanted to do. I followed a path that seemed prestigious: STEM classes, coding programs, and math competitions. I did not do these things because I enjoyed them at first. I did them because I thought they would make me look competent and successful to the people around me.

In grade seven, I was enrolled in coding classes that I did not like. I would sit at the computer, frustrated, unsure what to type, and convinced that everyone else understood it better than I did. It was only years later, when I returned to programming on my own terms, that I realized I actually loved it. That experience showed me how destructive comparison can be. I was doing something for everyone else, not for myself.

## the self-destructive cycle

High school became a constant cycle of measuring myself against others. I would see classmates' achievements, awards, summer programs, volunteer hours, and feel like I was falling behind. I set higher goals for myself, believing that ambition alone would make me enough, but I rarely paused to acknowledge my accomplishments. Every milestone felt temporary because I was already thinking about the next one.

This habit became self-destructive. I remember one calculus test where my mark was lower than I expected. It was not a failing grade, but I spent hours replaying every mistake in my head. I convinced myself that I would never get into my dream program. I lived in a mindset of avoiding expectations so I would not be disappointed. In reality, I was blocking myself from experiencing pride and satisfaction. Despite my doubts, I was accepted into my dream program. That moment highlighted how distorted my perception of myself had become because I was constantly comparing.

## external pressures

University intensified this pressure. At the University of Waterloo, I was surrounded by incredibly smart and ambitious peers. Many seemed to have everything figured out, securing competitive co-op placements, summer internships in California, and research opportunities. I constantly compared myself to them, worried that I was not doing enough to stay competitive.

I spent late nights scrolling through LinkedIn, comparing my resume and applications to others, questioning whether my experiences were "prestigious enough." I sometimes pursued opportunities for their reputation rather than my interest, just to feel like I was keeping up. Even when I accomplished something meaningful, I struggled to feel proud because my mind was already on the next benchmark, the next opportunity, the next comparison.

## psychological insight

What I experienced is called upward social comparison. Psychologically, it is natural to measure yourself against people who seem more successful. It can motivate, but it can also lead to stress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction if your self-worth depends on it. I realized that constantly comparing myself to my peers had distracted me from noticing my growth, celebrating achievements, and understanding my own values.

The shift happened when I started asking myself: Am I pursuing this because I want to, or because I feel I should? What am I proud of, regardless of what anyone else is doing? I realized that comparison can be a tool for inspiration, but it cannot define my value or accomplishments. True fulfillment comes from self-awareness, reflection, and acknowledging progress on your own terms.

## a work in progress

The biggest lesson I have learned is that comparison will always exist, but it does not have to control me. Ambition is important, but reflection is just as important. Growth is important, but noticing your own achievements is critical. My worth is not tied to someone else's co-op, resume, or internship. It is tied to my own progress, skills, and values.

I am still learning how to do this. I still catch myself scrolling through LinkedIn and feeling that pang of doubt. I still wonder if I am doing enough. But I am slowly learning to pause, reflect, and appreciate what I have accomplished. I am still working on it, and I know that it is okay for growth to be a journey rather than a race.
