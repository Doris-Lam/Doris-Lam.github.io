For a good part of my life, I had insane FOMO. I hated missing out on plans, on people, on moments. I felt like I always had to be doing something with someone. Whether it was walking to class, studying, or grabbing a coffee, I wanted company.

The idea of being alone made me uncomfortable. It wasn't even the silence that scared me, it was the thought that other people would look at me and think, "She has no friends." I thought being surrounded by people meant I belonged, that I was doing something right, that I mattered.

I relied on others as a form of validation. If I was with people, I was safe. If I was alone, I was doing something wrong.

## the fear of being alone

I remember one day in high school when everyone was busy after class, and I had to take the bus home by myself. It was such a simple thing, but I felt uneasy the entire ride. I remember sitting there, pretending to text someone just so I wouldn't look lonely. Looking back now, it's wild how much I cared about what strangers thought.

That fear followed me into university.

## first year: trying too hard to fit in

When I started first year, I told myself that to have a "successful" university experience, I needed a group, the kind you see in every campus brochure. The ones laughing in the dining hall, studying together, taking photos at events.

So I tried really hard. I said yes to everything, even things I didn't want to do. Activities that didn't interest me, late-night hangouts when I was exhausted, events I didn't enjoy. I'd spend hours around people but come back to my dorm feeling emptier than before.

I started to notice how my voice got quieter around them, how I'd agree with things I didn't actually believe, how I'd laugh at jokes that weren't funny just to seem like I fit in. Slowly, I lost myself in the process of trying to belong.

At some point, I wasn't even sure what I liked anymore. Did I actually enjoy those things, or was I just trying to be liked?

## the breaking point

Then came the moment that changed everything.

It wasn't dramatic, there was no big fight or falling out. Just a slow, painful realization that the people I had surrounded myself with didn't care about me the way I cared about them. Plans would happen without me. Conversations would fade when I wasn't the one reaching out.

I remember sitting in my dorm one night after realizing everyone had made a new group chat on iMessage without me. They were making plans together, and I wasn’t included. My first instinct was to cry. My second was to scroll through Instagram and see them posting together, and for a while, I did. But then something shifted. A quiet voice in my head whispered, “Why do you even care?”

It was the first time I thought about what it would mean to start choosing myself.

## learning to be alone

The first few months of being alone were rough. Meals in the dining hall felt uncomfortable and intimidating. Even though I didn’t have a meal plan, I’d sometimes go just to feel surrounded by people. But the moment I sat down, I’d immediately regret it. I felt out of place, like I didn’t belong there. I’d quietly eat my food, trying not to look around too much, while groups nearby laughed and talked like they had known each other forever. I’d tell myself no one was really paying attention, but deep down, I still felt like everyone could see how alone I was.

But eventually, I started to find small comforts in solitude.

One night, around 3 a.m., I decided to go for a walk around campus. No headphones, just me. The entire campus was silent, blanketed in snow. I walked through the empty streets, listening to the crunch of my shoes against the frozen pavement and the wind brushing softly against my face. For the first time, I noticed how beautiful campus actually was. Snowflakes drifted slowly through the air, and for the first time in a long while, I felt completely at peace. Just me, the quiet, and the night.

Another moment that stays with me was when I started exploring different buildings on campus, wandering into places I had never noticed before. I’d find hidden study spots tucked away in quiet corners, sometimes moving every few days just because I could. There was something freeing about it, knowing no one was keeping track of where I was or what I was doing, and for once, that felt comforting. I was learning to enjoy my own company, creating small pockets of peace in spaces that were entirely mine.

Bit by bit, those moments began to feel like freedom.

## finding myself again

Being alone taught me things no social circle ever could.

I learned to listen to my thoughts instead of drowning them out with noise. I learned to do things because I wanted to, not because I was scared of missing out.

I started reading more. Journaling. Going to study spaces I actually liked, not just the ones my friends preferred. I discovered how much I enjoyed walking without a destination, just letting my mind wander.

I began to enjoy my own company.

## what i know now

Being alone used to feel like punishment. Now, it feels like peace.

Its where I discovered that I was not really alone. I had myself, and that was enough. :)
